**Data Cleaning and Transformation**

This project involves cleaning and transforming housing data from the Nashville housing dataset. The **SQL** queries perform various data cleaning tasks including:

~Converting blank records to NULL  
~Standardizing date formats  
~Handling missing property and owner address information  
~Removing duplicate records  
~Splitting property and owner addresses into individual columns (Address, City, State)  
~Replacing 'Y' and 'N' values with 'Yes' and 'No'  
~Removing unnecessary columns.

The objective of these operations is to prepare the dataset for analysis and ensure consistency and accuracy across all attributes.
